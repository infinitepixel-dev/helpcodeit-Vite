      This is a website for learning JavaScript and other web development
      technologies. It is a work in progress, and will be updated regularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The site is build with React and managed by Michael Varnell. The content is intended to help beginning coders with some of the tasks that are often more difficult to understand due to jargon used in the industry and the complexity of the tasks themselves.
