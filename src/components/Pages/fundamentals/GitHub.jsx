                </h2>
                <p className="mt-4">
                    Imagine a library full of cookbooks (repositories). Each
                    cookbook has its own unique recipes (code). Chefs
                    (developers) come into the library to write, edit, or add
                    new recipes.

                <h3 className="mt-14 text-xl md:text-2xl">
                    1. Version Control
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Each time a chef makes changes to a recipe, they take a
                    photocopy of the page and date it. This way, if a new
                    version of a dish turns out not to taste good, they can
                    always go back to an earlier version of the recipe. This is
                    like saving multiple drafts of a document, where each draft
                    represents different stages of the document's evolution.
                </p>
                <h3 className="mt-8 text-xl md:text-2xl">2. Backup</h3>
                <p>
                    The library ensures that there are multiple copies of each
                    cookbook in various locations, so even if there's a flood or
                    fire in one part of the library, the recipes aren‚Äôt lost.
                    This is similar to how GitHub stores code in a distributed
                    manner, ensuring there's always a backup.
                </p>
                <h3 className="mt-8 text-xl md:text-2xl">3. Collaboration</h3>
                <p>
                    Multiple chefs can work on a single cookbook. If two chefs
                    want to modify the same recipe, one might create a photocopy
                    (a branch) and make changes there. Later, they can combine
                    (merge) their modifications with the main cookbook. The
                    library has a system in place (pull requests) for chefs to
                    propose changes, discuss, and then integrate those changes
                    into the main recipe.
