          <p className="text-lg">
            The Rubber Ducky Method is a simple yet effective technique for debugging and reviewing code. It is widely used, and taught by many in the tech industry and has even become a tradition. It involves explaining your code, line by line, to an inanimate object ‚Äì traditionally, a rubber duck.
          </p>
          <p className='text-lg'>The method's full origins may never be known, but the book 'The Pragmatic Programmer' by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas is where most of us learned about it. The book is an excellent read, that goes beyond just the coding parts of software engineering. Last we saw it was in its 20th edition, with the first one printed in 1999.</p>

            <li>Get a rubber duck (or any object)</li>

            <li>Explain your code to the duck, line by line</li>
            <li>As you explain, you'll often realize the solution to your problem!</li>
