# Testing Guide

This document provides instructions on how to run tests locally and guidelines for writing new tests for the project.

## Running Tests Locally

To run the tests locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed. Run the following command in the project root directory:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Tests**: Execute the tests using the following command:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

This will run all the tests in the project and display the results in the terminal.

## Writing New Tests

When adding new tests, follow these guidelines to ensure consistency and coverage:

1. **Test Structure**: Organize tests in a way that mirrors the project structure. For example, if you are testing a component in `src/components`, place the test file in the same directory with a `.test.js` extension.

2. **Test Naming**: Use descriptive names for test files and test cases. This helps in understanding the purpose of the test at a glance.

3. **Test Cases**: Write test cases for the following scenarios:
   - **Positive Tests**: Verify that the component or function works as expected with valid input.
   - **Negative Tests**: Check how the component or function handles invalid input or error conditions.
   - **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and unusual scenarios.

4. **Use React Testing Library**: Utilize React Testing Library for testing React components. Import necessary modules from `@testing-library/react` and `@testing-library/jest-dom`.

5. **Mocking**: Use mocks to simulate external dependencies and isolate the unit under test. This ensures that tests are reliable and do not depend on external systems.

6. **Assertions**: Use meaningful assertions to verify the expected behavior. Ensure that the assertions provide clear feedback when a test fails.

7. **Run Tests Frequently**: Run tests frequently during development to catch issues early. Integrate tests into the CI/CD pipeline to automate testing on push/pull requests.

## Example Test

Here is an example test for a React component:

```javascript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
import App from './App';

test('renders homepage link', () => {
  render(<App />);
  const homeLink = screen.getByText(/Home/i);
  expect(homeLink).toBeInTheDocument();
});

test('renders navigation links', () => {
  render(<App />);
  const aboutLink = screen.getByText(/About/i);
  const contactLink = screen.getByText(/Contact/i);
  expect(aboutLink).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(contactLink).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

Follow these guidelines to maintain a high standard of testing in the project.
